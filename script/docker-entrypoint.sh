	-= Initialize Configuration Files Directory =-

	You are about to overwrite any configuration files you may have existing 
	in the configuration directory, '${BIND_MOUNT_CONFIG_DIR}'.

	If you have made any customizations to any of these configuration files, 
	they will be overwritten with the default values contained in the default 
	configuration files located at '${CONTAINER_CONFIG_STAGING_DIR}'. 

	If you are using a bind mount through Docker to these configs, it's 
	recommended to make a backup of your configuration files before proceeding.

	If you're sure that you'd like to proceed, enter 'Y', if not, enter 'N' (or anything else).

	NOTE: If you've have run this option and have been immediately returned back to a prompt,
	make sure to run this Docker-run command using the '-it' command-line options.
